# Introduction
Los Angeles is a sprawling and diverse metropolis with a mix of neighborhoods representing various socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. In 2022, Los Angeles experienced an 11.6% increase in reported crimes compared to the previous year, marking the highest level of crime in the city in five years. At the same time, its rate of property crime was higher than the national rate. With California's overall crime rate at 83 incidents per square mile, Los Angeles notably exceeded this figure with a rate of 260 incidents per square mile. Moreover, crime reporting in Los Angeles saw a 4% increase from the previous year, indicating an increased number of reported incidents. 
# Dataset
We collected two datasets for our project. The first one is crime reporting which allows for a deep exploration of how different communities are affected by and respond to criminal activities. Analyzing crime reporting data provides insights into the trends and patterns of criminal activities over time. The dataset of arrest reporting allows for a clear observation of the effectiveness of the LA police office. Researchers and law enforcement can identify which types of crimes are more prevalent in certain areas, helping to develop targeted intervention and prevention strategies. Assessing crime reports helps law enforcement agencies understand where resources are most needed and refine their approaches to crime prevention.
The second one is arrest reporting, which can assist law enforcement in contributing to the development of effective crime prevention strategies. Law enforcement can implement targeted initiatives to address root causes and deter criminal behavior. Additionally, Policymakers can use these datasets to inform decision-making related to public safety policies and resource allocation. Understanding crime hotspots and trends guides the allocation of resources for law enforcement, community programs, and social services. These datasets offer a comprehensive view of urban dynamics, community safety,
law enforcement strategies, and societal responses to crime, which contribute to effective policies and the well-being of communities.

In our combined datasets, we added a new column named “Arrest day" as a numerical  variable in our combined dataset, which represents the difference between crime reporting and arrest reporting. Besides, we added a new categorical variable named “Sex Match”, which shows whether crime-reporting sex and arresting-report sex are the same. From the results, we can conclude that the most popular type of crime happened among the same sex or different sex. Each row represents each crime that is being arrested by the LAPD. These rows will contain the crime reporting date, arrest date, victim's sex, age, and area, and arrest sex, age and area. In sum, we can have the relevant information about victims and criminals.
The relevant variables directly correlated to our following results are “Crime Type”, “Crime Area”, “Crime Age”, “Arrest Age”, “Crime Sex” and “Crime Sex”.
